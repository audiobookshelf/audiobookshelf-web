[NPM (NGINX proxy manager)](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) is a docker-based reverse proxy intended to simplify configuration for NGINX. It does not expose very many settings, but is a good starting place.

Ensure websockets are enabled.

If you are using a nonstandard port (i.e. not 80 or 443), you will also need to change the Host header. This can be fixed by adding a custom location of "/" and adding `proxy_set_header Host $http_host` to the advanced configuration.

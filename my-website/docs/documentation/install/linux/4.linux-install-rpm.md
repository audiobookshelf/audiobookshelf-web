:::caution

- This installation method is **still in testing**.
- Only for **amd64** architecture.
- Supported operating systems are **Red Hat** and **CentOS Stream 8/9** variants.
- You cannot load a backup from another installation method after installation without losing progress. Use the [Docker installation](../docker) if you plan to switch drives or OS.

:::

## Installation

To activate the repository, run:

```bash
dnf install -y "https://github.com/lkiesow/audiobookshelf-rpm/raw/el$(rpm -E %rhel)/audiobookshelf-repository-1-1.el$(rpm -E %rhel).noarch.rpm"
```

Then install Audiobookshelf (all dependencies will be installed automatically):

```bash
dnf install audiobookshelf
```

## Configuration

You can configure Audiobookshelf in `/etc/default/audiobookshelf`.  
Here you can add the same configuration options you would pass to the Docker container.

```bash
METADATA_PATH=/var/lib/audiobookshelf/metadata
CONFIG_PATH=/var/lib/audiobookshelf/config
PORT=13378
HOST=127.0.0.1
```

By default, Audiobookshelf will listen on `localhost` only.  
This is sufficient if you install a **reverse proxy** (you should!).

To listen on all network interfaces, set:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## Start Audiobookshelf

To run Audiobookshelf and ensure it starts automatically after reboot:

```bash
systemctl start audiobookshelf.service
systemctl enable audiobookshelf.service
```

To check the current status of the service:

```bash
systemctl status audiobookshelf.service
```

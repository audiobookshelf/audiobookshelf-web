This section describes how to help contribute to Audiobookshelf. There are several main components to the project, including the server, mobile apps, and documentation. Please check any relevant sections when contributing.

## AI Tools

We do not accept or review PRs or issues that are fully AI-generated, as a growing number of such submissions consumes already limited developer and reviewer time. AI tools are not banned, but contributors are expected to apply human judgment and due diligence to ensure submissions have high quality.

Pull requests or issues that appear to be fully AI-generated with little or no human oversight may be closed without comment. This policy is not meant to discourage responsible AI use, but to ensure we can sustainably maintain and develop the Audiobookshelf project.

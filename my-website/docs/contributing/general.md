This section describes how to help contribute to Audiobookshelf. There are several main components to the project, including the server, mobile apps, and documentation. Please check any relevant sections when contributing.

There are many ways to contribute. Some ideas are included here:

- Code contributions: Code contributions are welcome! If you are a first time contributor, please try to make smaller PRs first before tackling big changes or adding new features. This makes it easier for us to review and for you to get more familiar with the project. We do our best to review PRs, but as this is a hobby project for a small team doing this in our free time, it can take a while to provide feedback or accept a PR.
- Design ideas: Visual mockups are a great way to provide more ideas on how to implement specific features.
- Documentation updates: If you notice a problem with the website documentation, please open a PR to help keep it up to date and improve it. This documentation is target for Audiobookshelf, and is not intended to provide guides for how to use other tools. For example, reverse proxy configuration is helpful to add, but users should read the documentation for the relevant reverse proxy instead of having us maintain an install guide (which can easily get out of date).
- Review help: Testing PRs to verify they perform as described helps to signal that a PR is ready for review by a project member.
- Edge testing: The `:edge` docker container is built on every push to the master branch. Using this image to help test new features and bug fixes before a release helps to make sure we did not miss anything in our testing.
- Financial: Donations can be made to [https://github.com/sponsors/advplyr](advplyr's developer profile). These donations are used to help with development costs. We believe the best way to support the project is still an investment of time for the project (everything mentioned above, helping answer community questions, etc), but this is also a viable option.

Thank you for taking the time to consider contribuing to Audiobookshelf!

## AI Tools

We do not accept or review PRs or issues that are fully AI-generated, as a growing number of such submissions consumes already limited developer and reviewer time. AI tools are not banned, but contributors are expected to apply human judgment and due diligence to ensure submissions have high quality (this also applies to human-generated PRs and issues but is more prevalent with AI tools).

Pull requests or issues that appear to be fully AI-generated with little or no human oversight may be closed without comment. This policy is not meant to discourage responsible AI use, but to ensure we can sustainably maintain and develop the Audiobookshelf project.

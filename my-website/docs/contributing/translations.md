Contributing translations is a fantastic way to help make the project accessible to more people. All of the translations are provided by the community. If you see a string that has not been translated or the existing translation is inaccurate, please help update the translations so others can also enjoy using Audiobookshelf in your langauge. If you do not see your language, reach out on GitHub or Discord so we can add your language to the project. Translations are managed by [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/audiobookshelf/) who has generously provided hosting for the Audiobookshelf project.

If you are adding a new feature, please only add the new strings to the English file `en-us.json`. There are two sets of translations: one for the [web client](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/tree/master/client/strings), and one for the [mobile apps](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app/tree/master/strings). Please keep the keys sorted in alphabetical order and do not edit the other language files.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the translation process, don't hesitate to ask for help on Discord. Happy translating!

Guides are user-contributed. Making a guide is a great way to support the community.

You can contribute a guide by creating a markdown file like [these](https://github.com/audiobookshelf/audiobookshelf-web/tree/master/content) in Github. If you aren't familiar with Github you can share that markdown file in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HQgCbd6E75) or [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#audiobookshelf:matrix.org).

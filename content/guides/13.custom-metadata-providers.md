This guide is for making and adding custom metadata providers.
ABS provides a few common providers (such as Audible, Google, iTunes, audiobookcovers), but does not include all providers or providers that do not have a public API.
Beginning in server version 2.8.0, users can add custom metadata providers.
This allows users to build custom tools or programs to allow ABS to interface with other metadata providers.

# Adding custom provider in ABS

A custom provider can be added to ABS through "Metadata Tools" in the server settings.
To add a custom provider you will need the address of the provider (a URL if a public community provider or the IP and port if you're running the custom provider yourself).
If an authorization token is needed you will also add that here.

These custom providers are run separately from ABS.
If you are using a community made provider, you will need to follow the directions for that specific provider's repository.
Issues with community providers should be brought up in the provider's repository and not in the main ABS repositories.
If someone has made their provider available at a public URL, you would not need to run anything yourself, but currently there are not any community providers hosted publicly.

# Creating custom provider

The request and response format that ABS expects for the API is defined in [this OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/master/custom-metadata-provider-specification.yaml).

# Community providers

These custom metadata providers have been made by the community and are not maintained as part of the core project.
If you have made a custom provider and want to share, you can [open a PR for this file](https://github.com/audiobookshelf/audiobookshelf-web/blob/master/content/guides/13.custom-metadata-providers.md) to add your information to the table.

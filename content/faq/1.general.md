This page aims to answer common general questions.

## Where can I get help?

1. Join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HQgCbd6E75).
2. Go to the [Github repo](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) and at the top left of the page you can search for your issue.

## I have a feature request. How should I bring this up?

First, check the GitHub issues. There are two repositories, one for the [server and web client](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf), and one for [the apps](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app).
You may need to try a few different search terms because someone else may have used different words to explain what they wanted.

If your feature request already exists, you can react with the "thumbs up" reaction to the top comment.
Please don't bump posts by just saying "+1" or "I also want this" unless you have something to add to the feature request.
You can also express support for an existing feature request in Discord.

If your feature request does not exist, you can create a new Feature Request or talk about it on Discord.

## How do I help with translations?

Contributing translations is a fantastic way to help make the project accessible to more people. All of the translations are provided by the community. If you see a string that has not been translated or the existing translation is inaccurate, please help update the translations so others can also enjoy using Audiobookshelf in your langauge. If you do not see your language, reach out on GitHub or Discord so we can add your language to the project. Translations are managed by [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/audiobookshelf/) who has generously provided hosting for the Audiobookshelf project.<a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/audiobookshelf/"> <img src="https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/audiobookshelf/horizontal-auto.svg" alt="Translation status" /> </a>

If you are adding a new feature, please only add the new strings to the English file `en-us.json`. There are two sets of translations: one for the [web client](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/tree/master/client/strings), and one for the [mobile apps](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app/tree/master/strings). Please keep the keys sorted in alphabetical order and do not edit the other language files.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the translation process, don't hesitate to ask for help on Discord. Happy translating!

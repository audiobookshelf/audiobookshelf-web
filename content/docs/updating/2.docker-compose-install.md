If you used docker compose, you just need to make sure the tag is either the version you want or `latest` if you want the newest release. If you want to run a specific release, such as older version, change the tag to the desired version number.

Then, you can just run the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --detach

# Audiobookshelf Deployment in Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**
   Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running. This deployment assumes you're using **nginx** as the ingress controller.

2. **Ingress Controller (NGINX)**
   Make sure NGINX ingress controller is installed and configured on your cluster. If you don't have it installed yet, you can follow the [official NGINX ingress controller installation guide](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/).

3. **Cluster Issuer for Let's Encrypt**
   You need a **ClusterIssuer** to automatically manage TLS certificates using Let's Encrypt. Below is an example configuration to create a ClusterIssuer:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: ClusterIssuer
   metadata:
     name: letsencrypt-production
   spec:
     acme:
       server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
       email: your-email@example.com  # Replace with your email
       privateKeySecretRef:
         name: letsencrypt-production-key
       solvers:
       - http01:
           ingress:
             class: nginx

* Replace your-email@example.com with your own email address.
* This will use HTTP-01 challenge for certificate issuance, with NGINX managing the ingress.

Apply this YAML to your cluster using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml
```
4. **Subdomain Setup (Optional)** If you want to use a subdomain, set up your DNS records to point to your Kubernetes cluster. In this case, I am using OVH as my DNS provider. Create an A record for your subdomain pointing to your clusterâ€™s IP address.

## Create Namespace for Audiobookshelf
First, create a dedicated namespace for Audiobookshelf:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: audiobookshelf-ns
```
Apply the namespace with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```
## Audiobookshelf Kubernetes Deployment
### 1. Audiobookshelf Service
Defines a service that exposes the Audiobookshelf application within the cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: audiobookshelf
  namespace: audiobookshelf-ns
spec:
  selector:
    app: audiobookshelf  # Matches the label from the Deployment
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP  # Exposes the service only inside the cluster
```
### 2. Audiobookshelf Ingress
Configures access to the Audiobookshelf service via a domain name and sets up TLS encryption:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: audiobookshelf-ingress
  namespace: audiobookshelf-ns
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production  # Refers to the Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer
    acme.cert-manager.io/http01-ingress-class: public  # Specifies the ingress class
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /  # Rewrites the URL to the service
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 2048m  # Sets the maximum allowed request body size
spec:
  rules:
  - host: audiobooks.example.com  # Replace with your domain
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: audiobookshelf  # The service to route traffic to
            port:
              number: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - audiobooks.example.com  # Replace with your domain
    secretName: audiobookshelf-tls  # Secret created by Cert-Manager
```
### 3. Audiobookshelf Deployment
Deploys the Audiobookshelf application with volume mounts for storing audiobooks, podcasts, and configuration files:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: audiobookshelf
  namespace: audiobookshelf-ns
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: audiobookshelf  # Matches the Service selector
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: audiobookshelf  # Matches the Deployment selector
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: audiobookshelf
        image: ghcr.io/advplyr/audiobookshelf:latest  # Audiobookshelf container image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80  # Exposes port 80 for the application
        volumeMounts:
        - name: audiobooks-volume
          mountPath: /audiobooks  # Mounts the audiobooks directory inside the container
        - name: podcasts-volume
          mountPath: /podcasts  # Mounts the podcasts directory inside the container
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /config  # Mounts the configuration directory inside the container
        - name: metadata-volume
          mountPath: /metadata  # Mounts the metadata directory inside the container
      volumes:
      - name: audiobooks-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /YOUR_PATH/audiobooks/  # Path on the host for audiobooks
      - name: podcasts-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /YOUR_PATH//podcasts  # Path on the host for podcasts
      - name: config-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /YOUR_PATH//audiobookshelf  # Path on the host for configuration files
      - name: metadata-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /YOUR_PATH/metadata  # Path on the host for metadata
```
Apply the full manifest:
```bash
kubectl apply -f audiobookshelf-manifest.yaml
```
Verify that the services, ingress, and deployment are running:
```bash
kubectl get all -n audiobookshelf-ns
kubectl describe ingress audiobookshelf-ingress -n audiobookshelf-ns

```

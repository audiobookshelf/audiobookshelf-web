  -e AUDIOBOOKSHELF_GID=100 \
  -p 13378:80 \
  -v </path/to/config>:/config \
  -v </path/to/metadata>:/metadata \
  -v </path/to/audiobooks>:/audiobooks \

**Docker on Ubuntu caution**

If you are installing audiobookshelf in a docker container on Linux, there are some limitations to be aware of.
  
    If you are running Docker as a snap on Linux, you must host your content under /home
    You will get terriblly misleading errors if you try to put them anywhere else, making it look like the device you are trying to use is read only when you go to start the container

**Volume mappings**

- /config will contain the database (users/books/libraries/settings)
- /metadata will contain cache, streams, covers, downloads, backups and logs
- Map any other directories you want to use for your book and podcast collections (ebooks supported as experimental)
- If you are using Docker as noted above on Linux, you cannot put the volumes anywhere except under /home

**Putting volumes on a second device**

In order to add a device to put your audio books on, if Docker is installed as a snap, one approach would be as follows.
- Create the user account and home directory
- Mount the new partition on the users home directory 
- Proceed with the docker run command from above

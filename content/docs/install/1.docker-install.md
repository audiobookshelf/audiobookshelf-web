Before you install audiobookshelf you must create a user account, the UID and GID of that account and it's group will be used in the docker run command below. 
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/advplyr/audiobookshelf

docker run -d \
  -e AUDIOBOOKSHELF_UID=99 \
  -e AUDIOBOOKSHELF_GID=100 \
  -p 13378:80 \
  -v </path/to/config>:/config \
  -v </path/to/metadata>:/metadata \
  -v </path/to/audiobooks>:/audiobooks \
  -v </path/to/podcasts>:/podcasts \
  --name audiobookshelf \
  --rm ghcr.io/advplyr/audiobookshelf
```

**Volume mappings**

- /config will contain the database (users/books/libraries/settings)
- /metadata will contain cache, streams, covers, downloads, backups and logs
- Map any other directories you want to use for your book and podcast collections (ebooks supported as experimental)
- If you are using Docker as noted above on Linux, you cannot put the volumes anywhere except under /home

**Docker installed as a snap on Ubuntu caution**

If you are installing audiobookshelf in a docker container on Linux and docker is installed as a snap, there is one particular limitation. 
  
    If you are running Docker as a snap on Linux, this build can only access files in the home directory. 
    You will get terriblly misleading errors if you try to put them anywhere else, making it look like the device you are trying to use is read only when you go to start the container

    One approach to work with that limitation would be to add a new mount for the audiobookshelf user home directory.
    - Create the user account and home directory
    - Mount the new partition on the users home directory 
    - Proceed with the installation as usual
